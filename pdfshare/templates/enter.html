        <p><h3><strong>What is HCHS Share?</strong></h3></p>
        <br>
        <p>HCHCS Share is a website made by me, a HCHS student for sharing notes. </p>
        <p>Because of the COVID-19 pandemic,
        I noticed that many students were out from school sick. To help absent students keep up with school work,
        I've made this website where students can both upload and see notes.
